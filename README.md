# Methods
A JNL221 repo of useful HTML/CSS tips and tricks, compiled by students.

## Instructions
-- In class, with your partner, pick a notecard. It will have instructions on what element or attribute you are working on understanding, and next class, explaining to the class.  

-- In this repo, click on the name of the folder that matches what's on your notecard and find your HTML file (with either _1245 for the 12:45 section, or _345 for the 3:45 section).  

-- Click on the file, click the edit button, select everything in the template and copy it.  

-- Open up a new, empty Sublime file and paste what you copied in there. You will add explanations and examples in here.  

-- Use p tags when you're explaining something, and use any other tags you need to explain your element or attribute. Don't forget - content goes in the body tag and CSS goes in the style tag. Use basic.html and reference_sheet.html as resources!  

-- When you're done adding everything into your Sublime Text file, copy-paste your content into the same Github repo file that you copied the template from. Add a commit message and commit.
