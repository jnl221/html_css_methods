# Methods
A JNL221 repo of useful HTML/CSS tips and tricks, compiled by students.

## Instructions
-- With your partner, pick a notecard. It will have instructions on what you are working on understanding, and next class, explaining to the class.  
-- In this repo, click through until you find your HTML file (with either _1245 for the 12:45 section, or _345 for the 3:45 section). Click on the file, click the edit button and select everything and copy it.  
-- Paste it into your own Sublime Text file and work in there.  
-- When you're done adding everything into your Sublime Text file, copy-paste your content into the same Github repo file. Add a commit message and commit.
